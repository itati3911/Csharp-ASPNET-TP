This repository showcases an E-Commerce project developed in collaboration with my classmates MattMaglio and MaximilianoAns as part of the coursework for Programming 3 and Computer Laboratory 3. It is a practical assignment for the Technical University Programming Degree at the Universidad Tecnol√≥gica Nacional (UTN Argentina).

The project is primarily written in C#, utilizing ASP.NET for web development and TSQL for database management. The goal was to create a robust and efficient E-Commerce platform, combining front-end and back-end technologies with a solid database integration.

We aimed to deliver a functional, educational, and professional-grade solution, showcasing the knowledge and teamwork gained during the course.
